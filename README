Do that damn catam problem better.

Setup part 1:

We have a LxL box, with temperature set to T = t0 at the left hand side and T = t1 at the right.  We seek the steady-state temperature i.e.

del^2 T = 0

The upper and lower walls are made of material that are infinitely insulating i.e. del T . n = 0 on a wall.

Analytical solution:

Obviously T = t_0 (1 - x/L) + t_1 (x/L)

Numerical problem:

Code that up using successive over-relaxation.  We don't consider state changes so set t_0 = 1, t_1 = 0, and L = 1.

On the upper and lower boundaries we have dT/dy = 0.  On the upper boundary we might take the right hand derivative

(t_0 - t_1)/h = 0, or t_0 = t_1.

In free space we wish to relax towards

del^2 T = 0

i.e. we have at fixed point (x, y)

d^T/dx^2 + d^T/dy^2 = T_d

CORNER DERIVATIVES:

On a convex corner the edges are bevelled to point at 45 degrees.

E.g. bottom left corner boundary conditions are (1.0/sqrt(2.0))*(dT/dx + dT/dy) = 0

and by taking a right-derivative on both of these

T_{i,j} = 0.5*(T_{i+1,j} + T_{i,j+1})
