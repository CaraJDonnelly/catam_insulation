Do that damn catam problem better.

Setup part 1:

We have a LxL box, with temperature set to T = t0 at the left hand side and T = t1 at the right.  We seek the steady-state temperature i.e.

del^2 T = 0

The upper and lower walls are made of material that are infinitely insulating i.e. del T . n = 0 on a wall.

Analytical solution:

Obviously T = t_0 (1 - x/L) + t_1 (x/L)

Numerical problem:

Code that up using successive over-relaxation.  We don't consider state changes so set t_0 = 1, t_1 = 0, and L = 1.
