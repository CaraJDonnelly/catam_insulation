I still don't know what I was supposed to deduce from this question.

I get that making the wall more porous decreases its insulative qualities.

The important thing is not the amount of insulation, it's the amount heat
will have to 'bend' to get through the holes.  More porous walls means
the heat barely has to bend at all -- just squeeze a bit.

Can't tell if this is making sense.

It's very frustrating not to find a smoking gun.  I thought I had one early
on but couldn't reproduce when I went down that alleyway.

Maybe tomorrow night I'll return to that first graph, 'Heat flux against
inverse of free space' with the periodic code, and a fixed aspect ratio,
and see if I can reproduce my straight line.  Right now I want to sleep.
